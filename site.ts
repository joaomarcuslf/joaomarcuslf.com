      "I am a software engineer with a focus on Back-end development and cloud-based solutions.",

      "Since 2014, I have been working in web development, starting with small website projects and progressing to building robust, scalable systems for global organizations. My expertise lies in Back-end development with technologies like Go, Python, Ruby, and Node.js, and I have significant experience designing APIs and architecting distributed systems optimized for cloud environments (AWS, GCP, and Azure).",

      "While my primary focus is on Back-end systems, I also have a strong foundation in Front-end technologies, having worked with React.js, React Native, AngularJS (1.x), Angular 4, and Vue.js. Additionally, I have hands-on experience with data visualization and reporting, leveraging Python for BI and Data Science.",

      "My technical toolkit includes extensive experience with Linux and MacOS for development, Git for version control, and agile methodologies such as Scrum, Kanban, and XP for project delivery.",

      "I am committed to continuous learning and staying updated with best practices and emerging technologies in software development. I have a passion for sharing knowledge, mentoring others, and improving communication and teaching skills to empower teams and foster collaboration.",
