<h4>Tech Lead | Cloud Computing | Go / Golang | Node.js | MongoDB</h4>

I’m a passionate software engineer with over 9 years of experience building scalable and efficient systems. Since 2014, I’ve had the opportunity to work with companies across the globe, including Brazil, North America, Europe, and Asia, gaining a deep understanding of diverse tech ecosystems.

I specialize in **Back-end development**, with a strong focus on **Go (Golang)** and **Node.js**, and have extensive experience designing and optimizing cloud-native architectures using **AWS** and **GCP**. My expertise also includes working with **MongoDB** for database solutions and leveraging modern technologies like **JavaScript/TypeScript (React.js, Next.js, Vue.js)**, **Python**, and **Ruby (Ruby on Rails, Sinatra)** to deliver robust, high-performance applications.

Whether it’s leading technical teams, architecting scalable systems, or mentoring developers, I’m driven by the challenge of solving complex problems and delivering impactful solutions.
