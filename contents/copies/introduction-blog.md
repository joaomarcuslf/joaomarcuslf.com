subtitle: Sometimes I fancy myself as a Tech Writer

Welcome to my tech blog! Here, you’ll find a mix of **presentations**, **external links to Medium**, **internal posts**, and **tutorials**.

Most of my posts are inspired by **mentorship sessions** or discussions with peers. When someone asks me to explain a concept or solve a problem, I often turn that into a blog post to share the knowledge with a wider audience. Whether it’s about **modern software paradigms**, **data structures**, **functional programming**, or **cloud computing**, my goal is to make complex topics accessible and practical.

Feel free to explore, and if you have any questions or suggestions for future posts, don’t hesitate to reach out!
