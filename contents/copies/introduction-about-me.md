<h4>Go | Node.js | Ruby | Python | MongoDB | React.js</h4>

I am a passionate software engineer and have been working since 2014. I've worked with companies in Brazil, North America (USA and Canada), Europe, and Asia. I have a degree in **System Analysis and Development**. I work mostly as a Back-end Engineer now, but in the past, I've worked with Beeon full-stack and Front-end. I also took many time holes as Tech Lead.

I have experience with JavaScript/Typescript (React.js, Next.js, Vue.js), Golang, Python, Ruby (Ruby on Rails and Sinatra), and MongoDB, and I primarily work with AWS and GCP.

I am an advocate for functional programming. I've worked with all major paradigms, but I value doing things **Simple** and **Efficient**, which I feel are characteristic of functional programming.
