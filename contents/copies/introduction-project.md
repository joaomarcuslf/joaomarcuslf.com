title: Interesting Projects
subtitle: Most of my work is private due to being company-realized, but here are some public projects to which I've contributed or created something myself.

My portfolio showcases projects in languages I've experimented with and enjoyed. I like Test-Driven Development (TDD); As a result, you can expect to find tests in most of my projects, and sometimes I also write smoke-tests, and integration tests.

Some projects are old ideas and are not maintained anymore, but I keep them here for historical reasons.

Nowadays, most of my projects are in the stack: Go, React.js, Ruby on Rails, Node.js, and MongoDB.
