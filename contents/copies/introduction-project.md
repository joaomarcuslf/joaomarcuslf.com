title: Interesting Projects
subtitle: Here are some public projects I’ve contributed to or created myself.

My portfolio showcases projects in languages I’ve experimented with and enjoyed. I’m a strong advocate for **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**, so you’ll find tests in most of my projects—ranging from unit tests to smoke tests and integration tests.

Some projects are older ideas and are no longer actively maintained, but I keep them here for historical context and to show the evolution of my work.

Today, most of my projects revolve around my core stack: **Go (Golang)**, **React.js**, **Ruby on Rails**, **Node.js**, and **MongoDB**. However, I’ve also had the opportunity to work with other technologies, including **Clojure**, **C**, and **IoT**, which have enriched my understanding of different programming paradigms and problem-solving approaches.
