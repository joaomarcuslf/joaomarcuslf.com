subtitle: Some of my mentorship have become articles.

Most of my posts are inspired by discussions with mentees or peers. When someone asks me to explain a concept or solve a problem, I often turn that into a blog post to share the knowledge with a wider audience.

Whether itâ€™s about **modern software paradigms**, **data structures**, **functional programming**, or **cloud computing**, my goal is to make complex topics accessible and practical.
